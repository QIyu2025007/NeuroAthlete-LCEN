# NeuroAthlete-LCEN

Leveraging Neuroinformatics to Understand Cognitive Phenotypes in Elite Athletes Through Systems Neuroscience

## 🧠 Overview

**NeuroAthlete-LCEN** explores the cognitive phenotypes of elite athletes through a novel neuroinformatics framework that leverages systems neuroscience methodologies. This project introduces the **Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN)** — an innovative model designed to disentangle and interpret latent cognitive traits influencing high-performance behavior.

By embedding biologically inspired constraints into modern neural architectures, LCEN provides deeper insights into how cognitive traits manifest and interact in elite populations. This research bridges neuroscience, psychology, and computational modeling, contributing significantly to our understanding of cognitive variability and elite human performance.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN):**
  - Disentangles complex cognitive factors using neural embedding.
  - Preserves interpretability with domain-specific constraints and priors.
  
- **Biologically-Inspired Architecture:**
  - Integrates systems neuroscience principles into model design.
  - Mimics structural and functional neural dependencies.

- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis:**
  - Handles heterogeneous data from psychological, physiological, and neural domains.
  - Enables robust, generalizable phenotypic predictions.

- **Experimental Validation:**
  - Evaluated across diverse elite athlete datasets.
  - Demonstrates superior accuracy in phenotype classification and interpretation.
